    <p id = "bio">I was born and raised in this beautiful state of Colorado. I'm a Chef, Glazier, Traveller, and Father to be! I love nature, and anything that involves
        a shot of adrenaline. I am excited to learn a new skill, and enter the tech industry. One day I have plans to open a Green Chili food truck, paired with the technical skills I can learn here, and in the future, the possibilities are endless. Happy Coding!
